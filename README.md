## Abstract
This paper presents empirical evidence on the impact of modern energy access and reliability of energy supply on education outcomes, specifically enrollment and test scores using two waves of India Human Development Survey. Electrification studies have generally focused only on the estimating the impact on two development factors - employment and household income. This research estimates the impact of electrification on educational outcomes, more specifically, school enrollment, school attendance, being on track in school (based on age), and test scores. Our preliminary findings are: 1) the children of households that have access to electricity are more likely to enroll in school, attend school regularly, and are on track in school; and 2) the children of households that have access to electricity significantly perform better than children from households that have no access to electricity. These findings suggest that the electricity positively impacts education.
